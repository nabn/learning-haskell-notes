* Creating a new project

    : stack new <project-name> <template-name>

This will create a directory with the given name, and fill it with a
base set of files.

A template specifies what files to create, and what to populate them
with. Good choices for a project are ~simple~ and ~new-template~.

* Adding dependencies

In the cabal file for your project, there are sections for
~executable~s, ~library~s, and ~test~s. Each of these sections can
have a ~build-depends~ section, where you can list your
dependencies. It could look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC cabal
library
  hs-source-dirs:     src
  default-language:   Haskell2010
  build-depends:      base >= 4.7 && < 5
                    , QuickCheck
                    , hspec
                    , checkers
#+END_SRC
