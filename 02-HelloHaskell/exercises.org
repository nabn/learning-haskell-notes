* Comprehension Check

1. Given the following lines of code as they might appear in a source
   file, how would you change them to use them directly in the REPL?

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  half x = x / 2
  square x = x * x
#+END_SRC

Answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  let half x = x / 2
  let square x = x * x
#+END_SRC


2. Write one function that can accept one argument and work for all
   the following expressions. Be sure to name the functions.

3.14 * (5 * 5)
3.14 * (10 * 10)
3.14 * (2 * 2)
3.14 * (4 * 4)

Answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  area r = 3.14 * (r * r)
#+END_SRC

* Parentheses and Association

Below are some pairs of functions that are alike excpet for
parenthesization. Read them carefully and decide if the parentheses
change the results of the funciton. Check your work in GHCi.

1. a. 8 + 7 * 9
   b. (8 + 7) * 9

Answer:

Yes the parentheses change the result (a) gives 71, while (b) gives
135.

2. a. perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
   b. perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2

Answer:

No, the parentheses do not change the result.

3. a. f x = x / 2 + 9
   b. f x = x / (2 + 9)

Yes, the parentheses do change the result.
