* Be Kind

Given a type signature, determine the kinds of each type variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- 1: what is the kind of a
g :: a -> a

-- 2 What are the kinds of b and T?
f :: a -> b a -> T (b a)

-- 3 What's the kind of c?
h :: c a b -> c b a
#+END_SRC

Answers:

1. ~*~
2. ~* -> *~ and ~* -> *~
3. ~* -> * -> *~
